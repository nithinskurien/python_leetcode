# 944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted
#
# You are given an array of n strings strs, all the same length.
#
# The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.
#
# For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as follows: abc bce cae You want to delete the columns
# that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e',
# 'e') are sorted, while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.
#
# Return the number of columns that you will delete.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
#   cba
#   daf
#   ghi
# Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: strs = ["a","b"]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
#   a
#   b
# Column 0 is the only column and is sorted, so you will not delete any columns.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
#   zyx
#   wvu
#   tsr
# All 3 columns are not sorted, so you will delete all 3.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# n == strs.length
# 1 <= n <= 100
# 1 <= strs[i].length <= 1000
# strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
#
# Logic:
# We can create 2 loops to iterate and compare the col with the previous row and see if the alphabets are descending if
# yes we increment the result and break. After iterating over all rows and col we can return the result.

class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, strs: list[str]) -> int:
        rows = len(strs)
        cols = len(strs[0])
        res = 0

        for col in range(cols):
            for row in range(1, rows):
                if strs[row][col] < strs[row - 1][col]:
                    res += 1
                    break

        return res
