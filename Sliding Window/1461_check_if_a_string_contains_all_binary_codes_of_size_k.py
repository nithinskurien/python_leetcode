# 1461. Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K
#
# Given a binary string s and an integer k, return true if every binary code of length k is a substring of s.
# Otherwise, return false.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "00110110", k = 2 Output: true Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11".
# They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively. Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "0110", k = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", it is clear that both exist as a substring.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: s = "0110", k = 2
# Output: false
# Explanation: The binary code "00" is of length 2 and does not exist in the array.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
# s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
# 1 <= k <= 20
#
# Logic:
# We can take a window of k elements and add it to a set and iterate the whole string. In the end we can check if the
# total count of the elements in set is 2^k

class Solution:
    def hasAllCodes(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        binary_codes = set()

        for index in range(n - k + 1):
            binary_codes.add(s[index: index + k])

        return len(binary_codes) == 2 ** k
