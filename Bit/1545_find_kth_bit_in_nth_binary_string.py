# 1545. Find Kth Bit in Nth Binary String
#
# Given two positive integers n and k, the binary string Sn is formed as follows:
#
# S1 = "0" Si = Si - 1 + "1" + reverse(invert(Si - 1)) for i > 1 Where + denotes the concatenation operation,
# reverse(x) returns the reversed string x, and invert(x) inverts all the bits in x (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0).
#
# For example, the first four strings in the above sequence are:
#
# S1 = "0"
# S2 = "011"
# S3 = "0111001"
# S4 = "011100110110001"
# Return the kth bit in Sn. It is guaranteed that k is valid for the given n.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 3, k = 1
# Output: "0"
# Explanation: S3 is "0111001".
# The 1st bit is "0".
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 4, k = 11
# Output: "1"
# Explanation: S4 is "011100110110001".
# The 11th bit is "1".
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 20
# 1 <= k <= 2n - 1
#
# Logic:
# The string will always have the first digit as a zero, the middle one as 1. So we can call the function recursively
# such that we have k less than 2^(n - 1) we can call the same function with the parameters(n - 1, k) and if k is
# greater than 2^(n - 1) we can the function with the parameters (n - 1, 2^n - k) but reverse the bit as the bits
# after the mid 1 are always reversed and inverted.
