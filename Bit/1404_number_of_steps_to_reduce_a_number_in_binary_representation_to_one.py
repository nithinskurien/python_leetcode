# 1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One
#
# Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the
# following rules:
#
# If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
#
# If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.
#
# It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "1101"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: "1101" corresponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
# Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14.
# Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
# Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
# Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.
# Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2.
# Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "10"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: "10" corresponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.
# Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: s = "1"
# Output: 0
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 500
# s consists of characters '0' or '1'
# s[0] == '1'
#
# Logic:
# If we simulate the sequence of events that happens when the LSB is 0 or 1 we see that for the case when the LSB is 1
# we need two operations (one to make it zero by adding one and then left shift to remove it) this leads to a carry
# otherwise we just need one operation.

class Solution:
    def numSteps(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        res = 0
        carry = 0

        for index in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            num = int(s[index]) + carry
            if num == 1:
                res += 2
                carry = 1
            else:
                res += 1

        return res + carry
