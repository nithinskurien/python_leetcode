# 3573. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock V
#
# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock in dollars on the ith day, and an integer k.
#
# You are allowed to make at most k transactions, where each transaction can be either of the following:
#
# Normal transaction: Buy on day i, then sell on a later day j where i < j. You profit prices[j] - prices[i].
#
# Short selling transaction: Sell on day i, then buy back on a later day j where i < j. You profit prices[i] -
# prices[j].
#
# Note that you must complete each transaction before starting another. Additionally, you can't buy or sell on the
# same day you are selling or buying back as part of a previous transaction.
#
# Return the maximum total profit you can earn by making at most k transactions.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: prices = [1,7,9,8,2], k = 2
#
# Output: 14
#
# Explanation:
#
# We can make $14 of profit through 2 transactions:
# A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $1 then sell it on day 2 for $9.
# A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $8 then buy back on day 4 for $2.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: prices = [12,16,19,19,8,1,19,13,9], k = 3
#
# Output: 36
#
# Explanation:
#
# We can make $36 of profit through 3 transactions:
# A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $12 then sell it on day 2 for $19.
# A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $19 then buy back on day 4 for $8.
# A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 5 for $1 then sell it on day 6 for $19.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= prices.length <= 103
# 1 <= prices[i] <= 109
# 1 <= k <= prices.length / 2
#
# Logic:
