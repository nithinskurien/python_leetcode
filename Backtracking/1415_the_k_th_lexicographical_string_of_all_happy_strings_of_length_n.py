# 1415. The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n
#
# A happy string is a string that:
#
# consists only of letters of the set ['a', 'b', 'c']. s[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (
# string is 1-indexed). For example, strings "abc", "ac", "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings
# "aa", "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.
#
# Given two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.
#
# Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 1, k = 3
# Output: "c"
# Explanation: The list ["a", "b", "c"] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is "c".
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 1, k = 4
# Output: ""
# Explanation: There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: n = 3, k = 9 Output: "cab" Explanation: There are 12 different happy string of length 3 ["aba", "abc",
# "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]. You will find the 9th string = "cab"
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 10
# 1 <= k <= 100
#
# Logic:
# We can use backtrack to create a list of strings with the desired happy strings and then return the k - 1 position as
# the result.

    def getHappyString(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        res = []

        def backtrack(curr):
            if len(curr) == n:
                res.append(curr)
                return
            for char in 'abc':
                if not curr or curr[-1] != char:
                    backtrack(curr + char)

        backtrack('')

        if len(res) > k:
            return ""

        return res[k - 1]
